================

A nice & easy profit calculator. Default hashrates set for one GTX750TI. 

- Supported exchanges: Bittrex, Mintpal, Cryptsy, Poloniex, AllCoin & AllCrypt.
- Supported coin info apis: WhatToMine, CoinTweak & CoinWarz.

- Filter to show only the "healthy" coins available on the supported exchanges & without frozen markets, low volume, etc...(applied on calculation)
- Option to include every exchange into the actual BTC price for a coin, but uses their volume for that coin as weight. Unchecked it uses the price of the exchange with the highest volume.
- Option to calculate USD/EUR/GBP/CNY per day.
- Option to calculate the electricity cost (if fiat is selected!)

- Supports NiceHash to get their actual prices for vendors/us miners.
- Supports PoolPicker to get the prices for a lot of different multipools and algos, averaging over X days. 

- Saves all settings and hashrates on exit and reloads them on launching the app.
